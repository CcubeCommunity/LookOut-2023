# Getting Started
This is the recommended path for getting started with AI/ML. But you can always choose your own path.

## 1. Math
Learn some math basics! Focus only on these topics, then come back later in case you need to learn more.

## 2. Python
Learn Python! It's the most popular language for AI/ML. You can learn it in a few days. You can also learn it while 
learning AI/ML. But it's better to learn it first.
