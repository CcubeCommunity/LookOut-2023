# Getting Started
This is the recommended path for getting started with AI/ML. But you can always choose your own path.

## 1. Math üìú
Learn some math basics! Focus only on these topics, then come back later in case you need to learn more.

* [Khan Academy - Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)
* [Khan Academy - Differential Equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations)
* [Khan Academy - Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
* [Khan Academy - Statistics Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
* [Optional: 3Blue1Brown - Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.3blue1brown.com/essence-of-linear-algebra-page/)

## 2. Python üêç
Learn Python! It's the most popular language for AI/ML. You can learn it in a few days. You can also learn it while 
learning AI/ML. But it's better to learn it first.

* [Codecademy - Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)
* [FreeCodeAcademy 4h Beginner Course](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw)
* [FreeCodeAcademy 6h Intermediate Python Programming Course](https://youtu.be/HGOBQPFzWKo)
* **Optional**: [Python Cookbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-cookbook-3rd/9781449357337/)
* **Optional**: [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)

After having a good understanding of Python, try out these questions from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/):
- [The minion game](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-minion-game/problem?isFullScreen=true)
- [ginorts](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ginorts/problem?isFullScreen=true)
- [Bot saves princess](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/saveprincess?isFullScreen=true&hr_b=1)
- [Bot saves princess 2](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/saveprincess2?isFullScreen=true&hr_b=1)
- [Bot clean](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/botclean?isFullScreen=true&hr_b=1)

You can use resources like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) for 
help. But don't copy-paste code. Try to understand it and write it yourself.

## 3. ML Stack üòú
Here come some of the most popular libraries for AI/ML. 

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Here is a [NumPy Tutorial](https://youtu.be/9JUAPgtkKpI).
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - A fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. Here is a [Pandas Tutorial](https://youtu.be/vmEHCJofslg).
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Here is a [Matplotlib Tutorial](https://youtu.be/3Xc3CA655Y4).
* **Optional**: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - A free software machine learning library for the 
  Python 
  programming language. Here is a [Scikit-learn Tutorial](https://youtu.be/0B5eIE_1vpU).
* **Optional**: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - An end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Here is a [TensorFlow Tutorial](https://youtu.be/tPYj3fFJGjk).
* **Optional**: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - An open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment. Here is a [PyTorch Tutorial](https://youtu.be/EMXfZB8FVUA).

## 4. AI/ML ü§ñ
Now you are ready to learn AI/ML! Here are some resources to get you started.
* [Kaggle Intro to ML](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
* [Kaggle Intermediate ML](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)
* [Machine Learning Specialization Andrew Ng | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) (3 Courses)

You can always continue with the rest of the courses in Kaggle and Coursera. But you can also start doing some 
projects at the same time while you are learning.

## 5. Hands-on perp üöÄ
Here are some of the datasets you can use for your projects.
